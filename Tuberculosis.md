**Tuberculosis** (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.

Many strains of tuberculosis resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take several types of medications for many months to eradicate the infection and prevent development of antibiotic resistance.

**Treatment**

With early detection and appropriate antibiotics, TB is treatable.

The right type of antibiotic and length of treatment will depend on:

    1. the person’s age and overall health
    2. whether they have latent or active TB
    3. the location of the infection
    4. whether the strain of TB is drug resistant

Treatment for latent TB can vary. It may involve taking an antibiotic once a week for 12 weeks or every day for 9 months.

Treatment for active TB may involve taking several drugs for 6–9 months. When a person has a drug resistant strain of TB, the treatment will be more complex.

It is essential to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms go away. If a person stops taking their medication early, some bacteria can survive and become resistant to antibiotics. In this case, the person may go on to develop drug resistant TB.

Depending on the parts of the body that TB affects, a doctor may also prescribe corticosteroids.
