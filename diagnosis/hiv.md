**What tests are used to diagnose HIV?**

Several different tests can be used to diagnose HIV. Healthcare providers determine which test is best for each person.
**Antibody/antigen tests**

Antibody/antigen tests are the most commonly used tests. They can show positive results typically within 18–45 daysTrusted Source after someone initially contracts HIV.

These tests check the blood for antibodies and antigens. An antibody is a type of protein the body makes to fight an infection. An antigen, on the other hand, is the part of the virus that activates the immune system.
**Antibody tests**

These tests check the blood solely for antibodies. Between 23 and 90 daysTrusted Source after transmission, most people will develop detectable HIV antibodies, which can be found in the blood or saliva.

These tests are done using blood tests or mouth swabs, and there’s no preparation necessary. Some tests provide results in 30 minutes or less and can be performed in a healthcare provider’s office or clinic.

Other antibody tests can be done at home:

    1. **OraQuick HIV Test**. An oral swab provides results in as little as 20 minutes.
    2. **Home Access HIV-1 Test System**. After the person pricks their finger, they send a blood sample to a licensed laboratory. They can remain anonymous and call for results the next business day.

If someone suspects they’ve been exposed to HIV but tested negative in a home test, they should repeat the test in three months. If they have a positive result, they should follow up with their healthcare provider to confirm.
**Nucleic acid test (NAT)**

This expensive test isn’t used for general screening. It’s for people who have early symptoms of HIV or have a known risk factor. This test doesn’t look for antibodies; it looks for the virus itself. It takes from 5 to 21 days for HIV to be detectable in the blood. This test is usually accompanied or confirmed by an antibody test.
