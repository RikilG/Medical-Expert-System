**Dengue** (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. A severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause severe bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.

Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific islands, but the disease has been increasing rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now the best prevention is to reduce mosquito habitat in areas where dengue fever is common.

**Symptoms**:
- high fever
- rash
- muscle and joint pains

**Treatment**

No specific treatment for dengue fever exists. Your doctor may recommend that you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration from vomiting and a high fever.

While recovering from dengue fever, watch for signs and symptoms of dehydration. Call your doctor right away if you develop any of the following:

    1. Decreased urination
    2. Few or no tears
    3. Dry mouth or lips
    4. Lethargy or confusion
    5. Cold or clammy extremities

Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can alleviate pain and reduce fever. Avoid pain relievers that can increase bleeding complications â€” such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others).

If you have severe dengue fever, you may need:

    1. Supportive care in a hospital
    2. Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte replacement
    3. Blood pressure monitoring
    4. Transfusion to replace blood loss
