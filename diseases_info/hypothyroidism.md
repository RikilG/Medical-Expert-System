**Hypothyroidism** (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

**Treatment for hyperthyroidism**

If your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and normalize thyroid hormone production. Sometimes, treatment can cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently. This often occurs after treatment with radioactive iodine.
**Surgical removal of your thyroid**
If your entire thyroid gland is removed due to thyroid problems, you’ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication for the rest of your life is the primary treatment.

If only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you’ll need.
**Radiation therapy**

If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer of the head or neck, lymphoma, or leukemia, you may have undergone radiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone. This will almost always lead to hypothyroidism.
**Medications**

Several medicines may lower thyroid hormone production. These include ones used to treat psychological conditions, as well as cancer and heart disease. This can lead to hypothyroidism.
