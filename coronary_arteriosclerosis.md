**Treatment**

Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.

_Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke._ For example:

    1. quit smoking tobacco
    2. reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
    3. exercise regularly
    4. lose weight to a healthy level
    5. eat a healthy diet (low in fat, low in sodium)

If your condition doesnâ€™t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:

    1. **balloon angioplasty**: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
    2. **coronary artery bypass graft surgery**: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
    3. **enhanced external counterpulsation**: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure 

**Prevention**

The same lifestyle habits that can help treat coronary artery disease can also help prevent it from developing in the first place. Leading a healthy lifestyle can help keep your arteries strong and clear of plaque. To improve your heart health, you can:

    1. Quit smoking
    2. Control conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes
    3. Stay physically active
    4. Eat a low-fat, low-salt diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains
    5. Maintain a healthy weight
    6. Reduce and manage stress
