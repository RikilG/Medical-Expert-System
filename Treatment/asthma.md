**Asthma** is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities difficult or even impossible.
Normally, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose and down into your throat, into your airways, eventually making it to your lungs. There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.

Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swell and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.

These conditions then bring on an asthma “attack,” the coughing and tightness in your chest that is typical of asthma.

**Treatment of asthma**

_Treatments for asthma fall into three primary categories: breathing exercises, rescue or first aid treatments, and long-term asthma control medications._

Your doctor will determine the right treatment or combination of treatments for you based on the type of asthma you have, your age, and your triggers.
Breathing exercises

These exercises can help you get more air into and out of your lungs. Over time, this may help increase lung capacity and cut down on severe asthma symptoms. Your doctor or an occupational therapist can help you learn these breathing exercises for asthma.
Rescue or first aid treatments

These medications should only be used in the event of an asthma attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again. Examples include:

    1. rescue inhalers and nebulizers, which are used with medicine that needs to be inhaled deep into the lungs
    2. bronchodilators, which work to relax the tightened muscles in your lung
    3. anti-inflammatories, which target inflammation in your lungs that could be preventing your breathing

If you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, you should sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer. Two to six puffs of medication should help ease their symptoms.

If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek medical attention.
Long-term asthma control mediations

These medications should be taken daily to prevent symptoms. Some rescue treatments, such as inhalers and nebulizers, can be used daily. However, your doctor will need to adjust your dosages.

**Asthma home remedies**

Complementary and alternative therapies should never be used during an asthma attack. If not treated properly, asthma can be life-threatening. The following remedies may help with mild asthma, but an asthma attack is a medical emergency. Follow your doctor's instructions and make sure an inhaler is available in case you need it.
Coffee or caffeinated tea

A chemical in caffeine acts similarly to the asthma drug theophylline. It opens up airways and may ease symptoms of asthma for up to four hours.
Essential oils

Inhaling eucalyptus essential oil may ease breathing difficulties brought on by asthma. Lavender and basil essential oils also show promise. However, for some individuals, inhaling essential oils may make asthma worse. Strong smells and chemicals can trigger asthma or worsen symptoms.
Mustard oil

This fatty oil, made from pressed mustard seeds, can be massaged into the skin to help open airways. Mustard oil is different than mustard essential oil, a medicinal oil which shouldn’t be applied directly to the skin.
