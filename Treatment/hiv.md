**AIDS** stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV disease.

HIV causes AIDS by attacking CD4 cells, which the immune system uses to protect the body from disease. When the immune system loses too many CD4 cells, you are less able to fight off infections and can develop serious, often deadly, infections. These are called opportunistic infections (OIs).

When someone dies of AIDS, death is usually due to OIs or other long-term effects of HIV. AIDS refers to the weakened state of the body’s immune system, which can no longer stop opportunistic infections.

**Treatment**
Adhering to antiretroviral treatment can reduce HIV to an undetectable viral load.

_No cure is currently available for HIV or AIDS._

However, treatments can stop the progression of the condition and allow most people living with HIV the opportunity to live a long and relatively healthy life.

Starting ART early in the progression of the virus is crucial. This improves quality of life, extends life expectancy, and reduces the risk of transmission, according to the WHO’s guidelines from June 2013.

More effective and better-tolerated treatments have evolved that can improve general health and quality of life by taking as little as one pill per day.

A person living with HIV can reduce their viral load to such a degree that it is no longer detectable in a blood test. After assessing a number of large studies, the CDC concluded that individuals who have no detectable viral load “have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner.”

Medical professionals refer to this as undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
**Emergency HIV pills, or post-exposure prophylaxis**

If an individual believes they have been exposed to the virus within the last 3 days, anti-HIV medications, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), may be able to stop infection. Take PEP as soon as possible after potential contact with the virus.

PEP is a treatment lasting a total of 28 days, and physicians will continue to monitor for HIV after the completion of the treatment.
**Antiretroviral drugs**

The treatment of HIV involves antiretroviral medications that fight the HIV infection and slows down the spread of the virus in the body. People living with HIV generally take a combination of medications called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

**Complementary or alternative medicine**

Although many people who have HIV try complementary, alternative, or herbal options, such as herbal remedies, no evidence confirms them to be effective.

According to some limited studies, mineral or vitamin supplements may provide some benefits in overall health. It is important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider because some of these options, even vitamin supplements, may interact with ARVs.
